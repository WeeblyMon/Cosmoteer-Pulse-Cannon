This is a mod i created for Cosmoteer, when it came out of its legacy version.

This mod introduces a custom weapon that I initially crafted as a 3D model before converting it into a 2D sprite. While this process might seem less efficient, my stronger skills in 3D art made it easier to trace over my 3D work to create the 2D version.

The weapon is an enhanced variant of the laser cannon, offering increased power but at a slightly higher cost.
